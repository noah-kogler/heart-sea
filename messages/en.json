    "text": "Eric Schirl and Christian Kogler examine OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) as a coping strategy and explore the human dilemma of uncertainty. In four chapters and in talks with people in various countries, the documentary film shines a light on the human psyche and different means of achieving at least apparent security. We get insights into personal and collective strategies for risk aversion, spiritual interpretations and possible solutions. In calm, reflective images, the film invites a deep contemplation of the interplay among the internal and external influences in our lives, and heightens our awareness of them.

In four chapters and in conversations with several people, their documentary sheds light on the psyche and different strategies to achieve security (at least a perceived one). We are provided insights into personal and collective mechanisms aimed at risk minimization, spiritual interpretations, and possible ways out. Using calm, reflective images, the film opens up a space for deeper meditations on the interaction of internal worlds and external influences, sharpening our awareness of this matter.
